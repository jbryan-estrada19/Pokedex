# Pokedex

V0.1: Created pokedex.py, a request API program to retrieve data from pokeapi.com 
V0.2: Created pokebelt.py, a streamlit website that allows the user to enter the name of the pokemon and searches for it using pokedex.py
V0.3: Created functions and deleted pokedex.py
      Implemented a csv-write function to store pokemon data into a csv file
      Implemented a validation mechanism that checks if the pokemon data is in the csv then fetches the data from the csv. If not, requests pokeAPI.com for the data then stores it in the csv.
      Fixed bugs. 

Next features:
1. Allow user to delete pokemon using while true
2. Error handling if pokemon is not in
